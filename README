***************************************

DNA analysis program.

author: Gerhart Mende

The program is released under the GPL 3.0 License, for more information read the LICENSE file.

***************************************

!!! The programm requires Java 7 to complile and run !!!

***************************************

compile the program:

LINUX:
use the 'make' command to build a jar-file and a executable script-file which starts the program

WINDOWS:
The Main-class is DNA_analyse.java

- compile the program with the console line (in the src folder): 'javac -target 1.7 *.java'

( 
  if you want, create a .jar file with the command:
  'jar cvmf META-INF/MANIFEST.MF DNA_analyse.jar *.class'
)

***************************************

starting the compiled program:

LINUX:
click on DNA_analy.sh

WINDOWS:
execute the DNA_analyse.jar file directly (if you create one) or start it with the console line 'java DNA_analyse'

***************************************

explanation about design:

There are 4 classes and 1 Interface.
The main class is DNA_analyse, it's contains the main function to starts the program and the example DNA sequence as a constant.
At first, the main function create an instance of the window class, which is responsible to display the user interface and layout.
The window class builds the user interface, and binds the buttons to an action handler, which is implemented by the ButtonPressed class. The function actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) of this class is called every time any button is clicked. It checks which button was clicked and perform the specified action. The logical parts of the analyese are implemented by the Analyse class, this functions defined in the Interface AnalyseI are called by the ButtonPressed class. When the analyse-function is finish, the ButtonClass adapts the display.

description and user guide:

When the program starts, you will see a white rectangle in the upper right corner, and three buttons above them.
Click the first button ('load example DNA') to load the DNA sequence given in the assignment, or click the second button ('load DNA from file') to load an other DNA sequence from your filesystem. The DNA sequence has to be available in .txt or .dat format.
The loaded DNA seqence will shown in the white rectangle. The programm automatically inserts a newline after every 60 signs. If the sequence is to large for the rectangle, you can scroll the content with the scroll-bar on the right side, this bar will only shown if it's required. Click the third button ('clear DNA') to clear the rectangle.

If a DNA sequence is loaded, the eight function-buttons on the left gets active. Click on one of the buttons to accomplish the specified analysis on the DNA sequence, you will see the result unter the button.
The pattern matching of the different analyzes are marked in the DNA sequence. When you click the button 'complementary', the complementary sequence will shown in the lower right corner in a second rectangle, and additionally a further button called 'switch', which is used to set the complementary DNA sequence in the upper box and vice versa, to anaylze the complementary DNA sequence.

Click the function-button a second time to clear the result from the specified analysis.
Click the EXIT button in the lower left corner to quit the program.

HAVE FUN!!!
